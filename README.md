# About the Project

# Overview

Hotelliste is a hotel search website with extensive features like easy comparisons between hotel prices, facilities, ratings, and location. It allows users to compare hotels, scaling across all the states of India.

We aim to help travelers to compare deals and find the right hotel. One needs to sign up to create an account ( users can also directly log in using their Google account). Then, you need to select the location, check-in and check-out dates, number of guests, and then search to find all relevant hotels on the go.

It doesn&#39;t end here. With a fantastic color scheme, dark theme, and great fonts, we have tried to keep the user our priority, taking care of the user experience.

## Krishanu Shah

This project greatly improved my skills in React. I was able to develop responsive and well designed web pages and components with ease.

## Divyanshi Chouksey

Projects always enhance the learning experience by allowing us to try what we have learned. Likely, this devsoc project also helped in improving my learnings in UX/UI design. I got better with design and the tools of various applications like Figma, and a little bit of AdobeXD.
